1. What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that include the application and its dependencies, ensuring that it works consistently across different environments.

2. Important Docker Concepts
•	Container: A runtime instance of a Docker image.
•	Image: A blueprint of a container that includes the application and dependencies.
•	Dockerfile: A text file with instructions to build a Docker image.
•	Docker Hub: A cloud-based repository where Docker images are stored.
•	Volumes: Used for persistent data storage for containers.
•	Networks: Enables communication between Docker containers.

3. Basic Docker Commands
•	Check Docker Version:
docker --version

•	Pull an Image from Docker Hub:
docker pull <image_name>
# Example
docker pull nginx
•	List Images:
docker images

•	Run a Docker Container:
docker run -d -p 80:80 <image_name>
# Example
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx

•	List Running Containers:
docker ps

•	Stop a Running Container:
docker stop <container_id>

•	Remove a Docker Container:
docker rm <container_id>

•	Build an Image from a Dockerfile:
docker build -t <image_name> .
# Example
docker build -t my-app .

•	Push an Image to Docker Hub:
docker push <dockerhub_username>/<image_name>

•	Log into Docker Hub:
docker login

•	Attach a Volume to a Container:
docker run -d -v /host/path:/container/path <image_name>

4. Writing a Simple Dockerfile

Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js image
FROM node:14
# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
# Copy the rest of the app files
COPY . .
# Expose the application on port 3000
EXPOSE 3000
# Start the app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

Explanation:
•	FROM specifies the base image.
•	WORKDIR sets the working directory inside the container.
•	COPY is used to copy files from the local machine to the container.
•	RUN executes commands to install dependencies.
•	EXPOSE specifies the port that the container listens to at runtime.
•	CMD defines the command to run the app.

5. Common Docker Networking Commands

•	Create a Network:
docker network create <network_name>

•	Run a Container in a Specific Network:
docker run -d --network <network_name> <image_name>

•	Inspect a Network:
docker network inspect <network_name>

6. Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications.

•	docker-compose.yml Example:

yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  database:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example

Explanation:
•	This file defines two services: web (Nginx) and database (MySQL).
•	Nginx is exposed on port 80, and MySQL is configured with a root password.

•	Start Services:
docker-compose up

•	Stop Services:
docker-compose down

7. Important Points to Remember

•	Immutable Infrastructure: Docker containers are immutable, meaning that changes in the code or infrastructure should lead to creating a new image and container.
•	Isolation: Containers ensure that applications run in isolation from one another.
•	Layer Caching: Docker uses layers to build images, which speeds up builds if the layers don't change.
•	Stateless: Docker containers are stateless by default. Use volumes to persist data.
•	Security: Regularly update Docker images to ensure you are using the latest patches.

8. Case Study: Implementing Docker in a CI/CD Pipeline

Problem:

A company wants to implement CI/CD for a Node.js application and deploy it as a Docker container.

Solution:
1.	Step 1: Dockerize the Application
o	Create a Dockerfile for the Node.js app.
o	Build the Docker image and test it locally.
2.	Step 2: Setup Jenkins
o	Install Jenkins on a server.
o	Configure Jenkins to pull code from the GitHub repository.
3.	Step 3: Create Jenkins Pipeline
o	Write a Jenkinsfile that builds the Docker image, runs tests, and pushes the image to Docker Hub.
o	Example Jenkinsfile:
groovy

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build('my-app')
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }
        stage('Push to Docker Hub') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', 'docker-hub-credentials') {
                        docker.image('my-app').push('latest')
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

4.	Step 4: Automate Deployment
o	Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container applications and automate deployment with docker-compose up.
Outcome:
The company now has a continuous deployment pipeline where code changes trigger a build, test, and deployment process. Docker ensures that the application runs consistently across environments.


9. Project Ideas
•	Containerize a Web Application: Take a simple web app (Node.js, Python Flask, etc.) and create a Dockerfile for it. Build the image, run the container, and make the app accessible on a specific port.
•	Multi-Container Setup with Docker Compose: Create a setup with a frontend (Nginx), backend (Node.js), and database (MySQL). Use Docker Compose to manage all services.
•	CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Docker: Integrate Docker into Jenkins to automatically build, test, and deploy a containerized application.
•	Monitor Docker Containers: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the performance and resource usage of Docker containers.
